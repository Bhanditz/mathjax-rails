# MathJax-Rails

We are living in an age, where displaying math on web pages is never hard, thanks to the great work of [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax). 

To quote the description from its official website,

  > [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all modern browsers.
  > 
  > No more setup for readers. No more browser plugins. No more font installationsâ€¦ It just works.

## Why bother another gem?

Integrating MathJax into a rails project however could be a pain. MathJax is HUGE. It makes your project folder swollen very much, because of the excessive amount of files contained in this package. Including mathjax inside your developing directory makes your TextMate less responsive, because when TextMate loses focus and then regains focus, it will scan the whole directory structure for change.

Another problem is, where to put? Put into `public` does not seem the best practice, since beginning with rails 3.1 `public` is by default ignored in production environment. Plus it is big, when using git, it leaves you no choice but to throw mathjax inside .gitignore, which makes sharing across developers less painless, and you then get no control over what version of mathjax that other developers use.

## So?

That's the time when mathjax-rails comes into play!

  * It put mathjax into a system-wide directory, which makes your own project never swollen.
  * By simply including mathjax-rails in your Gemfile, all your rails app can benefit from MathJax immediately.
  * You now are in control of the MathJax version by controlling the viersion of mathjax-rails, which is simplely done via Gemfile.
  
Since MathJax 1.1, some configuration is needed to include it in your html page. mathjax-rails also simplifies that in the rails way.

  * it comes with a include helper to let you quickly configure MathJax up.
  * And a generator that let you feel the power of MathJax right away.
